== Closing Remarks

=== Scala caveats

* Scala Development tools are not so great yet.
* Compilation is relatively slow

=== Use cases of Scala

* Scala is like a swiss-army-knife. But you only need a normal knife to
cut an apple.
* Remember, Scala is a JVM language ( uptil now )!
* Applications which already run on the JVM
* Enterprise Integration
* Web Services
* Quick prototyping
* Concurrent applications for multi-core machines: RxScala, Akka ( based
on Erlang's Actor Model )
* Domain Specific Languages
* And for fun!
